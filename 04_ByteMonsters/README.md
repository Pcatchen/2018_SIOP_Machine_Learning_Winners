# Byte Monster Code! # 

## Notes On How to Use ## 
* All code is located in the 00_code folder
* All code is written in R
* Some hyperparameters and external data are in 00_data 
* The first and main code to run would be [master_run_file](00_code/master_run_file.R) 
* Everything else should link through that one, sourced in the script.
* Enjoy and be sure to file an issue if you have a thought. 
* Special note: a large chunk of this code was written in one late-night session, LOL.
