The 2018 annual Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) conference featured the first-ever machine learning competition. Teams competed for several months with various analytical techniques to predict turnover in a large US company. Winning submissions had to be done in open source and are posted in this repository. A more complete introduction as presented at the conference can be found [here.](ML_Competition_Intro.pdf)
