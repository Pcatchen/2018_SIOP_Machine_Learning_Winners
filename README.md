# 2018 SIOP Machine Learning Competition Repository #
The 2018 conference featured the results of SIOP's first-ever machine learning competition. Teams competed for several months by experimenting with various analytical techniques for maximizing the variance explained in a large-scale data set. Those with the best results presented their methodsat SIOP 2018. Here is the repo with all their code and select presentations.  


### Problem ###
Predicting voluntary turnover at Eli Lilly  
Predict who voluntary left vs. who was still active as of December 31, 2014  

### Data ###
Data for 32,296 Eli Lilly employees active as of December 31, 2009  
162 predictor variables (demographics, location, job-related, job performance, etc.)  
Training set (n = 24,205)  
Test set (n = 8,091)  
Evaluation metric: Cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC) statistic.
