# 2018 SIOP Machine Learning Competition Repository #
The 2018 conference featured the results of SIOP's first-ever machine learning competition. Teams competed for several months by experimenting with various analytical techniques for maximizing the variance explained in a large-scale data set. Those with the best results presented their methodsat SIOP 2018. Here is the repo with all their code and select presentations.
