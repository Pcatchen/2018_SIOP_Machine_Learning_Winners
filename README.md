# 2018 SIOP Machine Learning Competition Repository #
The 2018 conference features the results of SIOP's first-ever machine learning competition. Teams have been competing for several weeks by experimenting with various analytical tech-niques for maximizing the variance explained in a large-scale data set. Those with the best results have been invited to present their methods and findings at SIOP 2018.
